### Set Up Methods

> Recommand Recommend by Recon Hong

* Template Matching(most simple one)
  * simplify the background image (with clean background )
  * image should be extremely similar to the one in database
  * more picture for each angle
* Matlab & Open CV
* Python Library
  * face
  * face and side
  
* Open CV
  * template matching

* data 
  * training  data (at least )
  * testing data
  
  * All image need to be processed by cutting the background first
    * make it easier to processed in theory
